# Arduino-Smart-Car-Kit-Basic-Movements
 Basic Movements: Arduino code to control forward, backward, left, and right motion for a 4WD smart car using a motor driver and four DC motors."
Arduino Smart Car Kit - Basic Movements
This project contains simple Arduino code to control a 4-wheel drive (4WD) smart car. The car uses four DC motors connected via a motor driver to perform basic movements like:

Move Forward

Move Backward

Turn Left

Turn Right

Stop

Components Used
Arduino UNO

L298N Motor Driver

4 DC Motors

4WD Chassis

Battery Pack

Jumper Wires

How to Use
Connect the motors to the L298N motor driver.

Upload the code from basic_movements.ino to your Arduino.

Power the car and test the movements.
